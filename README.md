# A Dockerized Jupyter notebook for back-testing in financial markets

## Abstract

This is a docker container based on the [data science notebook](https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks/tree/master/datascience-notebook) of [Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/).

It includes additional components that are useful for financial market back-testing, as well as data acquisition through the APIs made available by [Interactive Brokers](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/).

Some of the components included:
* IB TWS

    * [twsapi](https://interactivebrokers.github.io/)
* Backtesting
    * [backtrader](https://www.backtrader.com/)
* Plotting

    * [datashader](https://github.com/pyviz/datashader)
    * [holoviews](https://github.com/pyviz/holoviews)
    * [mpld3](https://github.com/mpld3/mpld3)
    * [plotly](https://plot.ly/)
* Misc
    * lxml, html5lib for pandas html_read

*Due to licensing restrictions, this container is only made available as a Dockerfile to be built by the end user, and not as a ready-to-run pre-built container.*

## Basic usage

Begin by checking out the Dockerfile and building the container:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/wk/docker-trader-notebook.git
sudo docker build -t trader-notebook docker-trader-notebook
```
